  // { id: 106, name: "Musicianship and Gear", content: "<h1> History <h1>Began playing drums in 1999 when I received a drum set as a birthday present. I learned to play on my own at first by playing along to \"Bad Company\" and \"The Dixie Chicks\". I then joined the concert band in 7th Grade and stuck with concertsymphonicmarching band through high school, becoming Drum Captain my JuniorSenior year of High School. I also wrote several cadences for the drum line using Finale. During my senior year of High School, I played my first major concert, performing with a select drum line as a feature act for the Shania Twain tour at Scottrade Center in St. Louis, MO.Once I left High School, I moved to Chicago for college for Digital Media Production. During my time in Chicago, I began playing drums for Derrick Streibig (who I still play with today in We Are Warm). After leaving college in 2007, I joined The Polebridge Electric company for a few Pacific Northwest shows as well as a recording session at Red Light Recording Studios in St. Louis, MO. I continued to play with Danny Freund and the Polebridge Electric Company and tour until 2011. In 2011 We Are Warm had a few recording projects and played many shows from the Pageant, Delmar Hall, Blueberry Hill Duckroom, Halo Bar and more.  During my time back in St. Louis, I began teching for Jake Elking (Shooting with Annie) and Bill Reiter (The Urge) for the Pink Floyd Tribute band, El Monstero. I also started drumming for Buz, Jake's personal electronica project. In 2012 Buz released an album with my debut and many performances at major venues in St. Louis, MO including Verizon Wireless Amphitheater and The Pageant. In 2018, Buz began work on a new album (after some time off for Jake to raise a couple children). We Are Warm has masters ready for a new Recording project release in mid-late 2018.I am currently working as a front end web developer but hope to find my place in a touring production or active recording projects. <h1>TechEngineering Experience<h1>Monitor Mixes (utilizing my XR18 Air by Behringer and XLR splitter to run monitors for each band mate.)<h1> My Inspirations <h1>Josh Freese (A Perfect Circle, Sting, Devo, NIN)Danny Carey (Tool) Benny Greb <h1>Style and Tone<h1>RockFunkBluesPopR&BCatch me on the drum kit or standing behind a rack of percussion. Either way I have great timing and dynamics as well as a great knack for communicating to my fellow musicians and not just keeping my head down. I love the warmth of coated heads and dark cymbals. Add a bright bell, kushy snare and thump from the kick and I'm all smiles. Love the clarity of my Ultimate Ear Triple driver custom in-ear monitors. I often depend on stage sound for extra low end and to feel kick and toms. <h1> My Current Gear <h1>Yamaha Stage Custom10\", 12\", 14\", 16\" Toms14\" x 5.5\" Stage Custom SnareZildjian A Custom 16\" CrashZildjian A Custom 18\" CrashMeinl Byzance Sand Vintage CrashRide 22\"Zildjian Custom K 13\" Hi HatsEvans G2 Coated (top and bottom) tom headsEvans EC Reverse Dot Snare headFull size drum shield (for those quiet singers)Roland SPD-SXLP TamborineMeinl Double Shaker", type: "Music - Percussion/Drummer", image: "http://www.charliehogland.com/portfolio/wp-content/uploads/201805/IMG_2044.jpg", description: ""},
