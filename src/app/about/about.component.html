            <h2><b>At the Office</b></h2>
            <p>

                I’m an ambitious Front-End Developer/UX Engineer
                located in St. Louis, Missouri. My focus is driven by my passion for the arts, entertainment, and the
                world wide
                web. I’ve been making websites since my early days of high school in 2001 when frames, tables, and
                animated GIFs
                were commonly used. The media has expanded a lot since I began and I do my best to continue to grow with
                it.
                I’ve been providing services since 2007 and work mostly with designers, agencies and other freelancers.
                I’ve
                been specializing in front-end development, WordPress, and responsive design for several years now, and
                enjoy a
                good challenge. JavaScript and CSS3 animations are now a favorite of mine. Code organization and
                semantics are
                extremely important to me, and I usually end up spending extra time just to rewrite a module to be a
                little bit
                clearer or easier to find.

                <br />My work assistants are two 90 lb. mutts that push
                me to work faster so they can go on walks sooner. When I’m not coding, I prefer to be traveling with my
                life
                partner, hiking/biking and playing drums. I’m always traveling to new places and lived in Chicago for a
                year in
                2006, Montana for nearly 2 years, traveling the Pacific Northwest playing with an Americana Rock band
                until 2008
                and have moved back to my hometown until my next adventure. I also enjoy wood working and simply
                breaking/fixing
                things as hobbies.
