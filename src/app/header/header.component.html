          <h4 class="text-white">About</h4>
          <p class="text-muted">ONLINE: I’m an ambitious Front-End Developer/UX Engineer located in St. Louis, Missouri. My focus is driven by my passion for the arts, entertainment, and the world wide web. I’ve been making websites since my early days of middle school in 2001 when frames, tables, and animated GIFs were commonly used. The media has expanded a lot since I began and I do my best to continue to grow with it. I’ve been in business since 2007 and work mostly with designers, agencies and other freelancers. I’ve been specializing in front-end development, WordPress, and responsive design for several years now, and enjoy a good challenge. JavaScript and CSS3 animations are now a favorite of mine. Code organization and semantics are extremely important to me, and I usually end up spending extra time just to rewrite a module to be a little bit clearer or easier to find. I enjoy staying busy! OFFLINE: My work assistants are two 90 lb. mutts that push me to work faster so they can go on walks sooner. When I’m not coding, I prefer to be traveling with my life partner, hiking/biking and playing drums. I’m always traveling to new places and lived in Chicago for a year in 2006, Montana for nearly 2 years, traveling the Pacific Northwest playing with an Americana Rock band until 2008 and have moved back to my hometown until my next adventure. I also enjoy wood working and simply breaking/fixing things as hobbies.</p>
